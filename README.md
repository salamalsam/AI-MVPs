# Educational MVPs for Learning and Development

This repository hosts a collection of open-source Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) designed and developed for educational and learning purposes. These MVPs aim to provide practical, hands-on examples for developers, students, and educators to learn various programming concepts, AI/ML techniques, and software development practices.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Share educational and development-focused MVPs.
- Enable learning through real-world examples and implementations.
- Encourage contributions, experimentation, and exploration.

## Current MVPs
### 1. **MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition**
   - **Description**: A TensorFlow-based AI model that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
   - **Features**: Dataset loading, model training, evaluation, and image prediction.
   - **Learn More**: Refer to the `README.md` in the respective directory for detailed instructions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salamalsam/AI-MVPs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory of the MVP you want to explore.
3. Follow the instructions in the specific `README.md` file of that MVP.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Virtual environment setup (recommended)
- Project-specific dependencies listed in each MVP's `requirements.txt`

## Setting Up the Environment
For consistency across MVPs, use the following steps to set up your Python environment:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file of the specific MVP:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new MVPs or improvements to existing ones, feel free to:
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch for your changes
- Submit a pull request

## Disclaimer
While these MVPs are designed with educational intent, they may not be fully optimized for production use. AI-related projects, in particular, may have limitations or inaccuracies and should be verified carefully when used in practical scenarios.

## Future Plans
More MVPs will be added over time, focusing on:
- Machine Learning and AI
- Web Development
- Data Science
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Educational Games

Stay tuned for updates!
